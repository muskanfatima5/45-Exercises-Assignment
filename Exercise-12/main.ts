//Q:12  Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each
//      person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, 
//      but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.


let friendsName = ["Sara","Hiba","Areeba","Alishba"];

friendsName.forEach(friendName => console.log(`Hello ${friendName}, How are you?`));
