//Q:42   Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great()
//       that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. 
//       Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (name) { return console.log(name); });
}
function make_great(magicians) {
    return magicians.map(function (name) { return "The Great ".concat(name); });
}
var magicians_names = ["Charlie", "Daniel", "Sam"];
var great_magicians = make_great(magicians_names);
show_magicians(great_magicians);
