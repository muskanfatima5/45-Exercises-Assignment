//Q:23  Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and 
//      your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//      let car = 'subaru';
//      console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//      console.log(car == 'subaru')
//    • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
//    • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

let five = 5;
let ten = 10;

console.log("\nTest 1: Five is equal to 5?");
console.log(five == 5);

console.log("\nTest 2: ten is equal to 10?");
console.log(ten == 10);

console.log("\nTest 3: 5 is not equal to 10");
console.log(five != ten);

console.log("\nTest 4: 10 is greater than 5");
console.log(ten > 5);

console.log("\nTest 5: 5 is smaller than 10");
console.log(five < ten);

console.log("\nTest 6: 10 is smaller than 5");
console.log(10 < 5);

console.log("\nTest 7: 5 is equal to 10");
console.log(five == 10);

console.log("\nTest 8: 5 is greater than 10");
console.log(five > 10);

console.log("\nTest 9: 10 + 5 is equal to 10");
console.log(10+5 == ten );

console.log("\nTest 10: 10 is not equal to 10");
console.log(10 != ten);
