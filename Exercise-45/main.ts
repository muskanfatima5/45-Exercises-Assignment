//Q:45   Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive
//       a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
//       Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an 
//       optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function create_car(manufacturer ,model ,...options)
{
    let car =
     {
         manufacturer: manufacturer,
         model: model
     };

     options.forEach(option =>
     {
         let[key ,value] = option.split(":");
         car[key.trim()] = value.trim();
     });

     return car;
}

let my_car = create_car("KIA","Sportage","color: white","sunroof: true","year: 2023");

console.log(my_car);
